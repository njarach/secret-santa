# A Secret Santa App
A simple secret santa app where a user can register a new event (you could theoritically create a totally non christmas event but the concept stays the same), add participants, and have them draw a 'receiver' for a gift.
## Stack
PHP 8.2, Symfony 7.3, Twig, TailwindCSS, htmx.
## Goal
Learn things, mess around with symfony 7, Tailwind, AI assistance. 
## Symfony Docker ?
I used Docker for local development, and ultimately removed it to simplify maintenance. Will go back to it when I'm able to do things properly.  
## Does it work ? 
As of right now it works, and is available here : https://secret-santa.nicolas-jarach-dev.fr/home
There are many issues to fix and features to add but I used it as our secret-santa platform for this year's family Christmas.

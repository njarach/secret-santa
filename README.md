# A Secret Santa App
A simple secret santa app where a user can register a new event (you could theoritically create a totally non christmas event but the concept stays the same), add participants, and have them draw a 'receiver' for a gift.
## Stack
PHP 8.2, Symfony 7.3, Twig, TailwindCSS, htmx.
## Symfony Docker ?
Yes, this is a learning/fun project so overkilling some things won't hurt.
## Generative AI ?
In this project I asked questions to a generative AI. I used components found online created with TailwindCSS, along with the Flowbite components library. I used generated
code for styling, for example in the custom form layout. No other code was generated.
